This is a simple MUD I've been working on and off on for the last few years. It has gone through several rewrites and reworks. This version is finally at a point where I feel comfortable releasing it and growing it further.

I'll add a package.json for required packages/npm at a later date.

Also, some directory names are very much hard coded to my home directory. Seriously, don't use this yet.
